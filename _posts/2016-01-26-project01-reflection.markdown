Our ethics code is posted at here{{http://www.davidmattia.xyz/viewPost/5}}. But I also posted it on my blog.

The new Code of Ethics for Notre Dame CSE students is a more specific, practical ethical code that relates to CSE students. We have a specific section for academic code of conduct for CSE students specifically, which covers various aspects on the specifc rules regarding CSE course work. For example, we have a section about group projects in CSE classes. Besides, we emphasize Notre Dame values in our code, urging students to consider the social impact and responsibility they have as computer scientists.

Some really interesting things we brought in are some very specific things we as computer science students could do. For example, we emphasize that CSE students should take time to volunteer with their professional skills. I think this aligns well with the core values at Notre Dame. We also value lifelong learning, which is also an important thing that the original code of ethics miss. Lifelong learning is especially important for computer engineers, as the field of computer science evolve really fast, and it's importan to always keep our skill set up to date.

I think some weaknesses for our ethics code it's not very clear how much we should regulate people. For example, for a group project, there will always be people who are stronger than others in a group, and maybe people could do better or learn more if someone do more work. Therefore, a code that is too strict might not be flexible enough to get the best learning experience.

Some other things that came to my mind when I was finishing the project, was that it is actually really hard to think about things that we could include. There are obviously so many things you could put in the ethics code, and it is really hard to pick out the things that matter the most, or how we should order those values. I find it a little bit hard to put down the very first rule, because I didn't know which one would be so important to become the very first. In the end, we chose to put honesty at the very first, because we think it is the very first step towards being a good person, and good computer scientist.

I think the Code of Ethics is really useful. It might not be sufficient to regulate, but having the code and making people aware of the code can be a huge help. It is an extra layer of consciousness to remind people of the things they should do. For example, maybe not everyone will do volunteer work in the end, but having this code would at least remind people of the things they could do as computer scientist, other than making a lot of money, or simply having fun themselves. Moreover, this also shows what the core value of our department is, and thus we can all advance towards that direction. I think writing this ethics code is also helpful for me to reflect on the things I value.
