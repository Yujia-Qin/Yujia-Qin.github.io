Provide a summary of the highlights of the new Code of Ethics and why you think those components are imporant.
No document is perfect. Are there weaknesses? What are they and why are they present? How can they be addressed?
Is a Code of Ethics really that useful? Was the enumeration of your principles and beliefs a beneficial exercise? Explain.


The new Code of Ethics for Notre Dame CSE students is a more specific, practical ethical code that relates to CSE students. We have a specific section for academic code of conduct for CSE students specifically, which covers various aspects on the specifc rules regarding CSE course work. For example, we have a section about group projects in CSE classes. Besides, we emphasize Notre Dame values in our code, urging students to consider the social impact and responsibility they have as computer scientists.

I think some weaknesses for our ethics code it's not very clear how much we should regulate people. For example, for a group project, there will always be people who are stronger than others in a group, and maybe people could do better or learn more if someone do more work. Therefore, a code that is too strict might not be flexible enough to get the best learning experience.

I think the Code of Ethics is really useful. It might not be sufficient to regulate, but having the code and making people aware of the code can be a huge help. It is an extra layer of consciousness to remind people of the things they should do.
