From the readings, the controversy about H1-B Visa is mainly about whether it brings more benefits to the US or potentially harm the employment for US citizens. People who are against the program often claim that H1-B Visas bring foreign workers to the US so that they would replace US citizens. Some also argue that companies like to hire H1-B workers because they are cheaper and they do not need to pay tax. A lot of people blame H1-B program, or foreigners in general, for taking their jobs. People who support the program believe that H1-B help retain talent that US companies need. They claim that the visa could attract top talent from the world to contribute the US economy.

I think I am in favor of expanding the use of H1-B visa. I am not a US citizen and I would need a H1-B visa to work in the US. I know from personal experience that many of the arguments against H1-B are not valid. Companies are much less likely to hire H1-B workers, because they would need to pay for visa application and lawyers. And they also have more risk hiring foreigners, since they are not guarenteed a visa and are more likely to leave the company in the future. In order to apply for H1-B, the company has to prove that they could not get a US citizen to fill the job. Therefore, I don't think H1-B visas would take jobs from Americans. Moreover, it helps to retain skilled workers and people with good education, who can actually make contributions to US companies. A lot of tech companies, like Google, Facebook, and many other, are in need of H1-B workers. They are software engineers whose jobs are not stolen from US workers; they get the job because the company could not hire enough software engineers from US citizens.

I also think it is important to regulate the H1-B application process. I am not very familiar with the issue, but I heard there are some large out sourcing companies that apply for tons of H1-B visas, and they are the ones who abused the systems. I think the <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/2988324/careers/increasingly-u-s-it-workers-are-alleging-discrimination.html">disney case</a> in the reading are one of the abuses. These companies often pay really low salary to foreign workers, and they cheat the H1-B visa lottery by filing multiple applications for one applicant. This greatly harms other applicants, and also tech companies that really need their high-skilled employees.

I will have to apply for H1-B visa to work in the US, but I still haven't figured out what I want to do with my life yet, so I guess that's a more important problem for me right now. As for the visa program itself from a very objective point of view, I think it would benefit the US economy, especially because it keeps bring in top talent from the world, and that is what makes US a great place. However, if the H1-B program still has the lottery system or is cancelled in the future, it could also be a good thing for other countries.
