My name is Cindy Wang and I am currently a junior major in Computer Science at Notre Dame. I come from China, so Chinese food is definitely my favorite. I love reading, and one of my favorite authors is Hermann Hesse - his book Glass Bead Game is awesome. I also enjoy drawing and painting, though I don't have a lot of time to paint now. And of course I love Computer Science. I love the feeling of mastering a language and make something that solve a problem and benefit people. I also find it interesting and challenging because Computer Science is evolving really fast and is related to many different fields. I am interested in many different things, and with Computer Science I could have some basic skills to solve problems in psychology, economics etc.

The main thing I want to get out of the class is the ability to analyze problems and decisions I need to make facing Computer Science. It is a new discipline and there are always problems emerging with the development of new technology. I hope the materials discussed in this class will help me to make more informed and rational choices related to my career.

I think one of the most pressing ethical and moral issues facing Computer Scientists is the problem regarding social impact and business development. As the author of "Programmers: Stop Calling Yourselves Engineers" suggest, tech industry and sillicon valley values building products that sell and scale. More and more emphasis on business is integrated in Computer Science. This definitely helps the development of new technology and its integration to society, but it is also one of the causes for the social problems made by new technology and business. As an unexperienced Computer Science student, I want to learn about how to balance the trend of fast product development and forming good software engineering practice.
