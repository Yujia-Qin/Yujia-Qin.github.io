After reading the articles, do you believe that coding is the new literacy? Should everyone be exposed or required to take a computer science or coding class?

What are the arguments for and against introducing everyone to computing or programming? What challenges will schools face as this CS4All push moves forward?

How should computer science fit into a typical K-12 curriculum? Is it an elective or a requirement? Does it replace existing subjects or is it an addition? What exactly should be taught in this CS4All curriculum? Is this computational thinking? programming? logic? computer literacy?

Can anyone learn to program? Should everyone learn to program? Explain why or why not to both.

After reading the articles, I believe that everyone should be exposed to coding and it should be a required class for K-12 education.

The arguments in the article <a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/jason-bradbury-coding-lessons-in-schools-are-a-waste-of-time">Coding lessons in schools are a waste of time</a> is kind of rediculous. The author claimed that soon computers will code for people, so learning how to code is a waste of time. Although compiler technology and increasing layers of frameworks have made coding more accessible for people, I don't think people can ever stop coding for innovation. A lot of development in various disciplines utilize computer science, like Economics, biology, and even art and literature. To create things with modern technology, people will need to know how to code. Besides, having something automated for you doesn't mean learning this particular knowledge is useless. We have calculators to do math calculations, and various other softwares and programs to do simulations, so it seems that math should be the most "useless" subject in the modern world. Yet I don't think anyone is going to take out math education soon. It is the methodology and thinking that developed while learning math that makes it valuable. The same arguments apply to computer science. It has become so important to modern life that learning basic computer science will be benefitial for people in the modern world.

I think computer science should be an added requirement. The class could be the very basic materials in computer science, so that everyone could approach and appreciate the basic methodology behind it. Just like not everyone likes math, there will be many people who don't like coding. However, learning about the very basics would still be valuable. This would also help with the gender issue in computer science, as it requires every girl to at least try computer science, no matter what message they receive from the society. I am not sure about the best format of this required CS basic class, but I think it could be computational thinking, which teaches high level ideas behind computer science, and possibly a little hands on coding.

I think everyone can learn to program, but not everyone can be a good computer scientist. I don't think everyone should necessarily know how to code, but at least know some basic computer science knowledge.  Technology is becoming more and more important for the modern world, and being able to understand the basics of technology makes people a more informed citizen. As someone said in the documentary Debugging the Gender Gap, learning computer science makes people become producer, instead of just consumer, of modern technology.
