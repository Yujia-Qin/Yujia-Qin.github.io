For this project, we wrote a letter to the Observer addressing issues on encryption and cyper security. Our project is posted on the link <a href="http://www.davidmattia.xyz/viewPost/15">here</a>.

I think encryption is a fundamental right. It protects privacy and people's sensitive information. With the development of technology, people are spending more and more time on the internet and are using electronic devices for all kinds of activities. It is easy to assume that these devices are safe and secure as any other personal belongings, while in fact they have certain flaws and risks that are not awared by the majority of the people who use them. Therefore, we need to educate the public about the potential risk they face, and thus they could make informed decison when they use the technolgy.

However, I do not think citizens should be allowed to have a technology that completely locks out the government. Technology is redefining the way people interact with the world, but it is still a new product that the society relies on. Therefore we need to make sure that it is also under good use. Cities and streets are under regulation by the government, so we feel safe and protected from crime. However, if we lock the government completely from technology, it is hard to feel safe when using the internet.

I think encryption is really important to me. I am always super careful when communicating with people about financial information on internet, and I try to be really cautious when browsing the internet or downloading stuff from websites. I also make sure that I do not have too much trust on technology. It might be a little funny, but being a computer science major actually make me more aware of the power and risk associated with it, and I try to be cautious with the things I do with my various online accounts etc.

I don't know how much encryption affect my stand on politics, but it definitely affects my choice with financial information and personal accounts. I don't really want to use online bankings that do not seem to have secure online service.

The conflicts between national security and personal privacy is a hard question. There is no right or wrong, and we need to be cautious to find a balance point. I think I am more in favor of national security at this point, because I think people could make some extra efforts to make their personal information more secure, and it is more important to protect our society from cyber attacks, terrorism etc. However, I think this issue will be an ongoing debate with supporters from both sides trying to find a good compromise.
