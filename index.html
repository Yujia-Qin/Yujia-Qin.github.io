				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I am a sophomore majoring in computer science at University of Notre Dame. I have a passion for exciting technology and genius design. Explore my little site to know more about me, or connect with me via links on the left.</p>
				<h2>Career Interest</h2>
				<p>I am a computer science major with an interest in art and design. I love coding for a good cause, for exciting projects and research that enhance people's lives. I find these two disciplines are fundamentally complimentary -- computer science is built upon beautifully designed systems, while many design principles are quite logical. </p>
				<p>Artificial inteligence, machine learning, media computing, and many other unknown computer disciplines are all quite attractive to me. I am exploring my "destiny" in computer science, just as Hesse did in the book Damian: </p>
				<p><i><q> to search for yourself, become sure of yourself, feel your way toward along your own path, wherever it led.</q></i></p>
				
				<h2>"Resume" Activities</h2>
				<p>Starting this semester, I am working on a project with professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sidneydmello/">Sydney D'Mello</a> that utilizes machine learning to study people's mind wandering and boredom while they are watching a "boring" movie(it's actually a Oscar winning movie).
				<p>I interned at <a href="http://www.springboardengineers.com/">Springboard Engineering</a> for NDwaves project, during which we designed, coded, and made creative instruments for <a href="http://www.thirdcoastpercussion.com/">Third Coast Percussion</a>'s new performance.</p>
				<p>I did <a href = "http://nano.nd.edu/education/nurf-program-overview/2014-nurf-recipients/">Nanotechnology Undergraduate Research Fellowship </a>during which I simulated and optimized Coplanar Waveguide.</p>
				<p>I am a member of SWE(Society of Women Engineers) and the website director of the <a href="http://2015sweregionhconference.nd.edu/">2015 SWE Region H conference</a>.</P>
				<p>I designed and created an English website for <a href="http://huatai.comoj.com/">Hebi Huatai Electronic Company</a>, a Chinese company, to assist their English speaking market.</p>
				<h2>"Leisure" Activities</h2>
				<p>I love hunting for interesting courses on <a href="www.coursera.org">Coursera</a>. The courses I have completed includes Machine Learning, Understanding Media by Understanding Google, and Creative Programming for Digital and Mobile Apps.</p>
				<p>Making quick sketches is one of the things I do to relax. The lotus logo on the left is one of my works. I am taking 2D foundations, a foundational design course.</p>
				<p>I love reading, especially classics. Although I don't have a lot of time for free reading during school years, I loved my literature seminar for which I read ten Greek classics and dramas.</p>
				<p>I like travelling and cooking, although most of the cooking is done at home with my mom and now most of the travelling is done without my mom.</p>
				<h2>Special Skills</h2>
				<p>I have interests in a lot of things, and I am a quick learner. I learned Arduino by myself for my internship project. I learned basic Java and algorithms online. I am also learning Python by myself.</p>
				<p>I can play Guzheng, a beautiful Chinese instrument. However, I couldn't take it with me because it's too big. I plan to buy one after I have my own apartment ;)</p>
